# Student Registration System

This project is a simple **Student Registration System** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It helps in adding, viewing, editing, and deleting student records in an easy and user-friendly way.  
All student data is saved using **Local Storage**, so the information is not lost even after refreshing the page.

---

## Purpose of the Project

The main purpose of this project is to understand how a real-world registration system works using front-end technologies.  
It also helps in learning **DOM manipulation, form validation, responsive design, and Local Storage**.

---

## What This Project Can Do

- Add new student details  
- Edit existing student records  
- Delete student records with confirmation  
- Search students by name, ID, class, email, contact number, or address  
- Keep data safe even after page refresh  
- Work smoothly on mobile, tablet, and desktop screens  
- Show a vertical scrollbar automatically when records increase  

---

## Student Details Stored

Each student record contains:
- Student Name  
- Student ID  
- Class  
- Email Address  
- Contact Number  
- Address

## Technologies Used

- **HTML** – Used to create the structure of the pages  
- **CSS** – Used for styling and making the website responsive  
- **JavaScript** – Used for logic, validation, DOM manipulation, and Local Storage

## How to Use the Project

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser  
2. Enter student details in the registration form  
3. Click **Add Student** to save the record  
4. Go to **View Students** page to see all students  
5. Use **Edit** or **Delete** buttons to manage records  

---

## Validation Rules Followed

- Student name allows only letters  
- Student ID allows only numbers  
- Email must be in valid format  
- Contact number must contain only numbers and at least 10 digits  
- Class and address cannot be empty  
- Empty records are not allowed

## JavaScript Concepts Used

- DOM selection and manipulation  
- Event listeners  
- Form validation  
- Arrays and objects  
- Local Storage for saving data  
- Dynamic content rendering  

---

## Data Storage

This project uses **Local Storage** to store:
- Student records  
- Daily registration count  

Because of this, the data does not disappear after refreshing the page.

---

## Assignment Requirements Covered

- Two different pages (Register & View)  
- Add, Edit, and Delete functionality  
- Dynamic vertical scrollbar using JavaScript  
- Form validation  
- Responsive design for all screen sizes  
- Clean file structure  
- Proper comments in code  
- GitHub upload with separate commits

## Conclusion

This project helped me understand how to build a complete front-end application using basic web technologies.  
It also improved my understanding of JavaScript logic, Local Storage, and responsive UI design.
